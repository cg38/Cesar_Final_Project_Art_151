      Maze Game With different levels, By:Cesar Guzman, 2022 </p>
    <p>
            This is my game which I have been working on for my final project for my Art 151 class. The Point of this game is to get to the end without touching the lines. If you were to touch the line it will send you back to the beginning and you will have to restart from the beginning. However, In the hard level the game changes a little. You are going to have to figure out which lines are crossable and need to have a good memory of which is the correct path. (There is a trick to that level, play to figure out) The images you see throughout these games were images I created in my assignments. I made these images similar to one an artist that I had to present in the class. His name was Rafael Rozendaal. I hope you enjoy the game I created.
